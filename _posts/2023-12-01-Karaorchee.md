<li> Developed a React Native app, which allows users to overlay their live solo performances with orchestral backing tracks in real time, built using expo and node.js, that uses Firebase as object storage and used MongoDB as relational database. </li>

<li> To automatically sync the orchestra entrances with the solo track, implemented an algorithm (modification of DTW) that detects musical onsets and offsets using MFCC features. </li>
