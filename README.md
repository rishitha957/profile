This website is based on [**Jekyll Now**](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). **Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)).

Design or Template of this website is just a modification of [Jon Barron's website](https://jonbarron.info/) and is repurposed for my own use. Huge thanks to him!
